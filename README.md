# Autonomous Landing of a Quadrotor on a Moving Vehicle

The task consists of the autonomous landing of a multirotor micro aerial vehicle (MAV)on a moving
ground vehicle (GV). Our focus in this work is to develop an algorithm enabling a feasible and
smooth landing. The drone has first to reach the waiting point and hovers at the height of 5 m
above the road. As soon as the car passes, the MAV starts the landing manoeuvre.

## Prerequisites
The simulation are performed using Simulink. We used also the Model Predictive Control Toolbox from Mathworks and the MATLAB Driving Scenario Designer application

## Getting Started
To run the simulation, open "initMain.m"
